Download images, including those in HTML meta-tag. Best use case is passing it URLs from a chat where you want to display a preview of the target destination.

# Usage
Add it to your manifest.json (replace 0.0.5 with the version you want):

```
{
  "dependencies": {
	..,
	"com.xucian.upm.grabtex": "https://github.com/xucian/upm-grabtex#v0.0.5"
  }
}
```
